# Code_Quiz
Gives the user a quiz on 10 random animal facts. After finishing the quiz, the user would be able to log in their score and it would be added to the leader board. I struggled getting my scoreboard to work. Overall, this project was hard for me to complete and may be lacking in some areas.
